# Filecredits

Contao module that adds credit support for images and files.

## Filecredits 2.x

Filecredits 2.x is a complete redevelopment. If you attached your custom modules to filecredits 1.x, we would not recommend to upgrade.

## How it works

- Copyrights can be added directly at the file within the contao file manager
- Page occurrences for images will be added automatically, on rebuild search index, or when the page with the image will be loaded
- A backend module is available to add custom filecredits with multiple page occurrences.
